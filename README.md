# Visualizing 25000 Soccer Matches QlikView

This is a data discovery project made with the help of QlikView BI tool.
I deployed a SQLite database in QlikView by loading and transforming the data using cross-tables and SQL queries. Then made a comprehensive dashboard using various charts, data tables and set analysis techniques for data discovery.

The 'Preview Dashboard' folder contains a few screen-shots of the dashboard. 

The SQLite data file was taken from Kaggle and it can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer.
